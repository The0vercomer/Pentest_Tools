# SecureCRT can be a great C2/Automation tool to add to your arsenal of Kali Linux Security Tools.

I have found that when attempting to install SecureCRT on the latest Kali Linux distribution release 2023.3 the following error persists when attempting to launch SecureCRT:
"SecureCRT: error while loading shared libraries: libicui18n.so.70: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"

I was able to find a workaround to this issue by installing the missing library from ubuntu's archive as seen below:

```
sudo apt update
wget http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/i/icu/libicu70_70.1-2_amd64.deb`
sudo apt install libicu70_70.1-2_amd64.deb
```

After completing the library installation you willbe able run the SecureCRT application. This workaroud has been tested with SecureCRT 9.4 and SecureCRT 9.5 Beta.
